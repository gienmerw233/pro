# Selenium-Python-UI-Automation

This repository provides the foundational setup for an automated UI testing project using Python, Selenium WebDriver, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.

For demonstration purposes, the example involves performing a simple search on DuckDuckGo to verify that search results are displayed correctly.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12.3 or later
- `pip` (version 24.0 or newer)
